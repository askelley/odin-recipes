        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Truly a Southern staple, an ice cold glass of sweet tea can cool you right down even on the hottest of days.</p>
        <p>Every true Southern knows - sweet tea <strong>must</strong> be made from scratch and cold unsweetened tea can <em>never</em> be properly made sweet!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Black tea of your choice <em>(I usually use Lipton brand)</em></li>
            <li>Granulated white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by boiling water on your stove</li>
            <li>Once water is boiling, remove water from heat and add tea bags to water</li>
            <li>Cover pot to trap heat inside</li>
            <li>Allow tea to steep for at least 30 minutes</li>
            <li>While tea is steeping, pour one cup of sugar into the pitcher <em>(You may wish to add more or less and adjust for sweetness)</em></li>
            <li>Once the time is up, pour the still hot tea into the pitcher and stir for 5 minutes or until sugar is fully dissolved</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
